## What I learned

I actually know the starter info really well, because this is my third time taking this class. I withdrew the first time, and received a D the second time. The first time I was just too lazy and turned inward when I was confused rather than seek help.

The second time, I put in some more work, but because I had already done some things the first semester, I didn't really put in much learning effort until the class caught up to where I was, which was bad because I had grown accustomed to not putting in effort until the wave caught up to me and eventually tipped me over.

Even though I have navigated through parts of this course a couple times, my goal this semester is to learn and be curious from the first day, even if it's repetitive. I will likely do the same project, and use some of the same code from previous semesters, since I liked how it turned out, but this time I will re-learn and re-understand, rather than take shortcuts.
